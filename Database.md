## 1. If we declare a unique index on the single column, then is it possible to add a null record in it?

Yes, it **is possible** to insert `NULL` values into a column with a **unique index**, but the behavior depends on the **database system** you're using. Here's how it works in some major databases:

---

### ‚úÖ **Behavior by Database:**

#### **1. MySQL**

* **Allows multiple `NULL` values** in a column with a unique index.
* Reason: `NULL` is considered as **not equal to any other value**, including another `NULL`.
* ‚úîÔ∏è Example:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
      email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
  );

  INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES (NULL); -- OK
  INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES (NULL); -- OK again
  ```

#### **2. PostgreSQL**

* Same as MySQL: **Allows multiple `NULL`s** in a unique index.
* ‚úîÔ∏è Reason: Follows SQL standard semantics.

#### **3. SQL Server**

* **Allows only one `NULL`** in a unique index.
* ‚ùå Second `NULL` causes a **violation** of the unique constraint.

#### **4. Oracle**

* Allows **multiple `NULL`s** in a unique index.
* ‚úîÔ∏è This is consistent with SQL standards.

---

### üß† Why This Happens:

According to the **SQL standard**, `NULL` is treated as **unknown**, and `NULL = NULL` is not true ‚Äî so uniqueness constraints typically don‚Äôt apply to `NULL` values.

However, **SQL Server is an exception** to this behavior.

---

### üß™ Want to allow only one `NULL`?

You can enforce this using a **partial index or filtered index**, depending on the database. For example:

* **PostgreSQL**:

  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX one_null_email ON users(email) WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
  ```

* **SQL Server**:

  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON users(email) WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
  ```

## I have an employee table. The employee table contains email ID, mobile number, and ID column. Can I apply an index on the gender column, which contains male, female, and other, and how it will be beneficial?
Yes, you **can** apply an index on the `gender` column in your `employee` table ‚Äî but whether it's **beneficial** depends on **how** you query the table.

---

### ‚úÖ Can you index the `gender` column?

Yes. From a technical perspective, there's **no restriction** on indexing any column, even if it contains only a few distinct values like:

```text
'male', 'female', 'other'
```

However, that doesn't mean it's **always useful**.

---

### üö© Is it **beneficial** to index the `gender` column?

It usually **isn't**. Here's why:

#### üîπ 1. **Low cardinality** = Poor index selectivity

* The `gender` column has **very few distinct values**.
* Indexes are most effective when the column has **high cardinality** (many distinct values ‚Äî like email, ID, or mobile).
* If 40% of your rows are "male", then scanning the index still results in retrieving **a large chunk of the table** ‚Äî not much faster than a full table scan.

#### üîπ 2. Index overhead

* Indexes take up space and add **overhead** on insert/update/delete operations.
* Maintaining an index that‚Äôs rarely useful can slow down writes without improving read performance.

---

### üß† When might it **make sense** to index `gender`?

You **might benefit** from it if:

* You have a **very large table** (millions of rows).

* You frequently query **combined filters**, e.g.:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employee
  WHERE gender = 'female' AND department_id = 5;
  ```

* In that case, you might use a **composite index**:

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_gender_dept ON employee (gender, department_id);
  ```

  This index could help narrow down rows more efficiently.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practice:

Unless your queries **frequently filter on gender + another column**, don‚Äôt index `gender` alone. Instead, focus on indexing:

* `email` (unique)
* `mobile_number` (unique or semi-unique)
* `employee_id` (usually primary key)
